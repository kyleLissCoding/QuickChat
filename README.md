# This is a basic console-based Chat developed with C++

Working on the basics of this currently, but it is one of my first projects in working with C++

This will allow users to create their own client and then communicate with other users via a TCP socket server
for direct messages back and forth

Trying to display and work on my Multithreading skills as well as Networking too!

# Instructions

A guide on how to run this will come as development proceeds further into a testing state

Also, this will most likely have an executable along with it too which will be available for download

# ATTENTION

This, along with my other projects, will be open for forking and building upon if you want to take my project
farther than where I'm at currently.
