### This is a basic console-based Chat developed with C++ ðŸ’¬

I have finally finished a rough draft of the application where basic functionality is working!

This will allow users to create their own client and then communicate with other users via a TCP socket server
for direct messages back and forth

Currently this only works for a single local computer, but I want to add functionality for different computers to connect as well

Trying to display and work on my Multithreading skills as well as Networking too!

## Instructions

# For Repo Terminal usage

1. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`

2. Generate build files: `cmake ..`

3. Build the project: `make`

4. Run the server: `./quickchat server`

5. Run clients in separate terminals: `./quickchat client`

# For Executable usage (Executable is located in the "build" folder)

1. Navigate to the executable folder

2. Start a terminal at the folder location

3. Select either of the following options: `./quickchat server` or `./quickchat client`


# ATTENTION

This, along with my other projects, will be open for forking and building upon if you want to take my project
farther than where I'm at currently.
